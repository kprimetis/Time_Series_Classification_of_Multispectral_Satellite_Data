# Time Series Classification of Multispectral Satellite Data
## Project Description
This repository contains the third Project 3 of the course "Geospatial Data Analysis and Processing" in the MSc "Data Science & Machine Learning" program. This exercise focuses on designing and implementing a time series classification methodology for multispectral satellite data using **Transformer-based architectures**.

## Objectives
1. **Familiarization with Time Series Remote Sensing Data**

  * Understand and work with time series data from Sentinel-2 satellites.

2. **Model Design and Implementation**

  * Design a time series classification model using a **Pixel Set Encoder** and **Transformer Encoder** architecture.
  * Study and implement parts of scientific publications related to Transformer models for time series classification.

3. **Data Preprocessing and Augmentation**

  * Preprocess and normalize data.
  * Implement data feeding algorithms with random sampling techniques.

4. **Model Training and Evaluation**

  * Train and evaluate the classification model using various metrics and strategies.
  * Implement a k-fold cross-validation strategy to assess model performance.
